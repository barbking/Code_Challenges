## Fun code challenges - Forget crossword puzzles, I'd rather do a code challenge!

### Algorithms
Algorithm: a set of rules for solving a problem in a finite number of steps, as for finding the greatest common divisor.  The Big O is basically a way to describe an algorithms “abstract” performance in operation as the operation’s inputs grow in size toward infinity.

#### Sorting Algorithms
Bad: Insert, Selection
Good: Merge, Quicksort

Quicksort - what JavaScript's native .sort() uses
