## Fun code challenges - Forget crossword puzzles, I'd rather do a code challenge!

### Algorithms
Algorithm: a set of rules for solving a problem in a finite number of steps, as for finding the greatest common divisor.  The Big O is basically a way to describe an algorithms “abstract” performance in operation as the operation’s inputs grow in size toward infinity.

#### Sorting Algorithms
- Bad: Insert, Selection
- Good: Merge, Quicksort

Quicksort - what JavaScript's native .sort() uses.  Quicksort is a divide and conquer algorithm. Quicksort first divides a large array into two smaller sub-arrays: the low elements and the high elements. Quicksort can then recursively sort the sub-arrays.(from Wikipedia)
